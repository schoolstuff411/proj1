The question stated that we used fake values, so we are definitely p hacking here.

2. If we had done T-tests between each pair of sorting implementation results,
we would have to run n(n-1)/2 = 7(6)/2 = 21 t tests. If we do three T-tests, then the probability of no incorrect rejection of the null is 0.95^7 = 0.70. We suddenly have an effective of 0.30, which is much less confidence in our results.

3. Ranking by speed is partition sort, qs1, qs3, qs4, qs5, qs2, merge1.

The ones that could not be distinguished are:
qs2, qs3
qs2, qs4
qs2, qs5
qs3, qs4
qs3, qs5
qs4, qs5
